Full stack Portfolio - Deadline: Monday August 14

Submission: Send all links to repositories and any hosted urls, along with any necessary credentials to test the app, to Ryan and Shayne.

You will be building a custom portfolio app to showcase your work and resume. This is to be full stack, so we want to see you utilize your skills in front-end and back-end development. Use the following tools:

VS Code
Git & Github
A frontend built with React, React Router Dom, and SCSS
A backend built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, and Postgres

Feature List:

Portfolio
Showcase apps and other work
About
Download or display resume
Info about yourself
Individual Portfolio Item Show Page
Info about the item itself
Appropriate links to showcase (code sandbox, repl.it, GitHub, etc)
Contact Page
Submission form
X Embedded Map that centers on your city
X Personal Admin Login Page
Inbox
The contact form will submit to your own inbox that you can see when you're logged in
Add / Edit Page or Pages for the Portfolio Items
X ERD
X Map out the data using a design tool of your choice (draw.io, figma, etc)
Seed Script
Write a script that will seed your database with mock data.

X Your backend should provide the necessary api to persist and fetch the data needed from your db.

You will be the only user on the app as far as authentication is concerned, so you don't need any other user profiles or registration. Login is primarily so that you can authorize yourself with the api for protected routes (IE: updating or deleting items should be protected).

The front-end should have route guards in place so if you're not logged in, you couldn't get access to certain pages (like the add portfolio workflow, for example).

I'm not going to be too picky about the overall styling, however, potential employers may look at this so present it the way you'd like to be viewed.

Full CRUD for portfolio items.

The data for Portfolio Items should at least have:

Title
Description
Project URL
Project Image
You can add anything else you want to fit your needs.

Create proper data flow, good code composition, follow best practices, naming conventions, etc.

This is an INDIVIDUAL project. You can only use your mentors to ask for generic help with conceptual understanding. You may NOT use ChatGPT or any other generative AI software to assist you. This will result in an automatic failure. You may NOT use Foundation as a starting point.

You don't have to host this, but you should try when you get the chance.
